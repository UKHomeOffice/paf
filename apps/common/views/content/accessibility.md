This accessibility statement applies to the Public Allegations Form on Home Office Forms.

This website is run by Home Office. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

We are aware of the following issues. 

<ol class="list list-number">
<li>The session timeout of 20 minutes cannot be changed and the user is not alerted when it is running out. This for each individual page of the form, not the form overall. This does not meet WCAG 2.2 Enough Time.</li>

</ol>

At this time, this service does not contain any content that is exempt from the regulations

We are developing functionality to alert the user their session is about to time out and allow them to extend the session. We are aiming to deliver this in Q2 2024.

# Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 18 March 2024. It was last reviewed on 18 March 2024.

This website was last tested on 18 March 2024 against the WCAG [2.1 or 2.2] AA standard.  

The test was carried out as a self-assessment by the form team. The most viewed pages were tested using automated testing tools by our website team. A further audit of the website was carried out to the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.
